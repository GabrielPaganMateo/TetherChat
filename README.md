# Secure Text Transfer Application

##### The project aims to securely share textual information to ensure privacy, confidentiality, and integrity. Many banking applications use secure data exchange apps and functions to share information using certain channels.

Data security and cloud computing are the areas focussed on in this project. I will use encryption as the security technique to preserve the information properties. Diffie-Hellman key exchange is the suitable algorithm for carrying out encryption and decryption. This is because it will serve for private and public keys involved in encryption and decryption. The two-way encryption technique used in the project will strengthen security. An additional feature can also be to exchange images securely by utilizing the application. Using SQL database for data storage as it has built-in security tools and features. Using AWS cloud servers to activate the entire process.
